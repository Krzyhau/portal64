![](./assets/images/gameplay.gif)

This is a mod for a demake of Portal for the Nintendo 64 made by James Lambert. If you're interested in Portal 64, visit the [main repository](https://github.com/lambertjamesd/portal64/) instead.

The mod aims to create a fully-functional replica of 20th test chamber from Portal 2 - Triple Laser. This includes:

- [X] A recreation of the level, in a style of Portal 1
- [ ] Fully functional lasers
- [X] Laser emitters
- [ ] Laser redirection cubes
- [ ] Laser catchers

For now, if you want to play it, you have to compile it for yourself. Follow the compilation process from the README.md in the [Portal 64 repository](https://github.com/lambertjamesd/portal64/) - it should be exactly the same.
