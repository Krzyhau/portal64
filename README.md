![](./assets/images/gameplay.gif)

This is a mod for a demake of Portal for the Nintendo 64 made by James Lambert. If you're interested in Portal 64, visit the [main repository](https://github.com/lambertjamesd/portal64/) instead.

The mod aims to create a fully-functional replica of 20th test chamber from Portal 2 - Triple Laser. This includes:

- [X] A recreation of the level, in a style of Portal 1
- [X] Fully functional lasers
- [X] Laser emitters
- [X] Laser redirection cubes
- [X] Laser catchers

If you want to play it, dowload the patch file and follow the patching instructions in the [Release page](https://github.com/Krzyhau/portal64-triple-laser/releases/tag/v0.00000000000000000000001). However, you're free to compile it for yourself if you wish. Follow the compilation process from the README.md in the [Portal 64 repository](https://github.com/lambertjamesd/portal64/) - it should be exactly the same.
